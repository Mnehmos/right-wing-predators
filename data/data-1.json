Law repeatedly transferred abusive clergy among parishes despite repeated allegations of child molestation, without alerting parents or police. Notable cases include priest John Geoghan who raped or molested over 130 children in six parishes. In January 2002, The Boston Globe published investigation results revealing Law's systematic cover-up. The archdiocese eventually paid $10 million to Geoghan's victims in 2002 and an additional $85 million to 552 victims and parents in 2003.",

The settlement included highly unusual provisions requiring all parties to disclaim any evidence as 'counterfeit or forgeries' should it become public.
