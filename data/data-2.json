    "description": "Glenn Murphy Jr. was a prominent Republican politician who served as president of the Young Republican National Federation. In August 2007, he resigned from his position after being accused of sexually assaulting another man. The assault allegedly occurred on July 29, 2007, when Murphy, age 33, performed oral sex on a 22-year-old man without consent while the victim slept. The assault happened following a Young Republicans gathering and after a night of drinking at the victim's sister's house. Murphy pleaded not guilty to the charges but was convicted of class B felony sexual assault. He was sentenced to six years in prison and is now a registered sex offender. Additionally, another man had accused Murphy of sexual assault in 1998, though no charges were filed at that time.",

He was indicted on charges of sexual assault (a second-degree felony) after being accused of raping a church member who came to him for counseling following a miscarriage. According to police reports, Owens told the woman that she was possessed by a sex spirit and lesbian demon that needed to be cast out. He then allegedly asked her to lie on the floor where he conducted what he described as an exorcism, yelling at her as if performing a demonic casting, saying 'Loose her in the name of Jesus,' before he raped her. The alleged assaults occurred twice at his Fort Worth home. Owens was arrested in November 2006 and held on $25,000 bail, facing charges that could result in 2-20 years in prison.",

In February 2008, Zimmerman was indicted on charges of producing child pornography. According to investigators, Zimmerman solicited two teenagers, ages 16 and 17, to perform lewd acts that he photographed and videotaped for the purpose of creating pornography. Specifically, Zimmerman paid the boys to photograph themselves while masturbating with the intention of publishing and reselling the images as pornography. A former TV newsman, Zimmerman was fired by DCF following his arrest. In January 2009, he pleaded guilty to one count of producing child pornography. Other charges were dropped as part of a plea agreement. Zimmerman was sentenced to 24 years and four months in federal prison.",

According to prosecutors, Kauffman believed he was communicating with a 13-year-old girl in a Yahoo chat room during November and December 2007. In reality, he was communicating with Jim Murray, a retired detective from Diamond, Missouri who conducts online child sex predator stings. Murray's sting operations have led to over 20 arrests with more than half resulting in prison time for adults convicted of soliciting sex from minors. Kauffman resigned from his positions as mayor of Collins and pastor of Temple Lot Church following the charges.",
