Law repeatedly transferred abusive clergy among parishes despite repeated allegations of child molestation, without alerting parents or police. Notable cases include priest John Geoghan who raped or molested over 130 children in six parishes. In January 2002, The Boston Globe published investigation results revealing Law's systematic cover-up. The archdiocese eventually paid $10 million to Geoghan's victims in 2002 and an additional $85 million to 552 victims and parents in 2003.",

He resigned from the legislature in October 2017 when the allegations surfaced. According to documents released by the Idaho Attorney General's Office, Hixon was accused of sexually abusing two young girls. His ex-wife told police that Hixon had raped and inappropriately touched one alleged victim for approximately 11 years. Hixon was never charged with any crime, as he took his own life before the case could be presented to a grand jury. Police reports indicate Hixon had attempted suicide at least three other times in the recent past.",

Aaron targeted and sexually abused multiple boys ages 8-12. In 2009, he agreed to consecutive life terms in prison for production of child pornography and first-degree sodomy of multiple child victims under 12 years old. While at his former church in 2005, Aaron was investigated for allegedly making a verbal sexual advance to another youngster, but no charges were filed due to statute of limitations. Aaron was a retired Navy man and had lived in the Andalusia community for about 7 years before his crimes were exposed.",
